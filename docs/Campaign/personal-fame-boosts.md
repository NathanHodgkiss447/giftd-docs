# Personal Fame Boosts

An extremely important aspect of a campaign are the personal fame boosts. As stated previously, each player earns fame points through winning battles. During a campaign, a player can exchange these points for 'Fame Boosts', which increases the rate at which they earn fame points. **Do not buy a fame boost without asking an FC,** as this could completely screw your campaign over if you buy too many or too few boosts.
