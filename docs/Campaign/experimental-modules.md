# Experimental Modules

Due to Wargamings infinite wisdom, each player gets a variety of 'experimental modules' which can be mounted on a tank to provide additional characteristics.
Only one module can be mounted on tank at a time & each player gets a limit of three of each modules.
**Only use these modules when instructed by your FC.**
