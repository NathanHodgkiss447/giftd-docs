# Workshop

Every campaign, individual players have the opportunity to assemble a second reward tank, usually a variety of tier 7/8 tanks. This is done through an in-game interface (see below) where players queue various resources in order to 'build' a tank.
These resources are earned by participating in clan battles during the campaign.

It is important to note that *we do not prioritise* workshop vehicles.
