# Campaign Overview

- **Duration:** Typically lasts two weeks.

- **Schedule:** Starts 5PM CEST => 1AM CEST (be on TeamSpeak at least 15 mins before games start).

- **How it works:**
  - You earn personal fame points during the campaign for battles won, this determines your individual position on a leaderboard (also known as the [alley of fame](https://worldoftanks.eu/en/clanwars/rating/alley/#wot&aof_front=thunderstorm_bg&aof_rating=accounts&aof_filter=all&aof_page=0&aof_size=25)).
  - Individual position on the leaderboard (alley of fame) results in a reward tank of your choice (*only the tanks on offer for the specific campaign*) and a certain amount of bonds. (EG: Top 8,000 players earn a reward tank).
  - The clan also earns fame points, the higher the clans position on the leaderboard results in a larger multiplier that is applied to individual bonds earned. (EG: X5 multiplier on 600 bonds = 3,000 bonds for a player).

- **How teams are selected:** Simply, teams are chosen based off a mixture off three criteria as follows
  - Activity (Continuous throughout the year, not just pre-campaign).
  - Skill (General player ability).
  - Communcation (Voice communication on TeamSpeak, not in the #memes-fun channel...)

- **Doodle**: Each campaign a Doodle link will be sent out to the entire clan in order to understand total player availability, to be considered for selection in a team, this **must** be filled out and kept as up to date as possible
throughout the campaign. (Example [Doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/fp3q4pbxgbkmahc9S)).
